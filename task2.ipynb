    "The Pacman is an agent that moves around the grid. When it encounters a cell with a breadcrumb, it \"eats\" it and gets a\n",
    "positive reward. When all of the breadcrumbs are consumed, he wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacman moves 1 cell for each timestep in one of 4 directions; up, down, left, right. All 4 sides of the \n",
    "environment grid contain obstacles so that the agent cannot move out of the grid. In addition there are more obstacles\n",
    "inside the grid as well. If the Pacman tries to move into an obstacle, he gets a negative reward and returns back to the \n",
    "cell he moved from. If the Pacman moves into an empty cell, he gets a small negative reward. This is an incentive to get \n",
    "game completed as quickly as possible.\n",

    "The whole algorithm is run from the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this code, check in the config.py file for the configurable parameters used in this algorithm.\n",
    "This includes the number of breadcrumbs, the location of the breadcrumbs and the location of the obstacles.\n",
    "The Pacman is more likely to win if there are fewer breadcrumbs in the grid.\n",
